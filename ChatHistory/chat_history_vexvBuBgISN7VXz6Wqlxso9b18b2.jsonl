It's a cornerstone of understanding how electricity works.\n\n**Here's the core idea:**\n\nThe amount of current flowing through a circuit is *directly proportional* to the voltage applied across it, and *inversely proportional* to the resistance in the circuit.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\nThis relationship is expressed mathematically as:\n\n**V = I * R** \n\nWhere:\n\n* **V** = **Voltage** (measured in **Volts - V**) - This is the electrical potential difference, or the \"push\" that drives the electrons. Think of it like water pressure in a pipe.\n* **I** = **Current** (measured in **Amperes - A**, often just called \"Amps\") - This is the rate of flow of electric charge. Think of it like the amount of water flowing through a pipe per second.\n* **R** = **Resistance** (measured in **Ohms - \u03a9**) - This is the opposition to the flow"}]}
